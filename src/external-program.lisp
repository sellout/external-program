   "Runs the specified program in an external (Unix) process,
returning a process object if successful.

`INPUT`, `OUTPUT`, and `ERROR` all behave similarly, accepting one of
the following values:

* `NIL`, specifying that a null stream (e.g., `/dev/null`) should be
  used;
* `T`, specifying that the `EXTERNAL-PROCESS` should use the source or
  destination with which the Lisp was invoked;
* a stream;
* a pathname designator, to redirect to/from a file;
* `:STREAM`, which creates a new stream opened for character input or
  output (accessible via the `EXTERNAL-PROCESS-*-STREAM` functions);
  or
* `:OUTPUT`, (only available for `ERROR`) which directs the error
  output to the same destination as the standard output.

`ENVIRONMENT` contains an alist mapping vars to values.

`REPLACE-ENVIRONMENT-P` indicates whether the argument passed as `ENVIRONMENT`
should replace or extend the current environment. The default is `NIL` (to
extend the environment).

`STATUS-HOOK` is a function the system calls whenever the status of
the process changes. The function takes the process as an argument.")
